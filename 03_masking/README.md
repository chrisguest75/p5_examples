# MASKING

Build an example of a masked logo.  

Put some noise in the background and fade through it.  

TODO:

* Fade the SVG opacity through
* Mask the outline of the logo https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_masking.asp
* https://web.dev/articles/css-masking
* Use something like gsap to move different logos around.
